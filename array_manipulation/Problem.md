Given a l-indexed array initially filled with zeros and a list of operations, perform each operation by adding a value to each element of the array between two given indices (inclusive). After performing all operations, find and return the maximum value in the array.

For example, let's consider the following

scenario: q= [[2.4.5].[3.6,3].[1.7.10]] 
Initial Array size = 7
Array: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
